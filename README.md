# CGCloud - LWC Addons

This project houses some of my Lightning Web Components that I created for several Consumer Goods Cloud demos. These components may not be ready to be put into production, but happy to accept any pull request to harden them or to add more features.

Prerequisite to install these components are the same for any LWC component + it is advised to only install these components in a Salesforce org with [Consumer Goods Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/eu/products/consumer-goods-cloud/overview/) enabled.
